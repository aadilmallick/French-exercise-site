# 2b - Cognates

In this lesson you will learn about the cognates between french and english.

## Standard cognates

### **-ation to verb**

---

Any english noun that ends in “ation” and has a verb form can be easily translated into french to find the infintive equivalent.

:::tip

1. Each -ation word in english has an equal french cognate ending in -ation, often with an accent.
2. Each -ation word in english has an equal french cognate ending in -acion, often with an accent. You can take from this cognate, remove the -ion and replace with -er to get the infinitive representing that sustantive noun.
   :::

For example, we can take “organization” from english, drop the -ation to get “organiz”, and then and an -er to get the french infinitive “organicer”
