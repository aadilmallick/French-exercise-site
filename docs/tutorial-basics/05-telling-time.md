# 5 - Telling the time

To tell the time in french, you follow military time, and you would say something like "1 hour, 30 minutes" to say 1:30 AM, and "13 hours, 30 minutes" to say 1:30 PM:

- **Il est sept heures =** it's 7 oclock
- **Il est treize heures =** it's 1:00 PM

## **adding and subtracting numbers**

here is some necessary info before learning this trick

- To say a "quarter" (15 min) in french, it's _le quart_.
- To say a "half" (30 min) in french, it's _le demie._
- To add minutes, you use _et_ which means "and"
- To subtract minutes, you use _moins_ which means "minus"

The basic formula of adding minutes and quarters is so, noting that you omit the definite article and just say the number of _quart,_ except in the case of moins.

> et + (quart/demie/number)

> moins + (le quart/le demie/number)

:::info
Spanish Comparison: Et quart ≈ y cuarto, et demie ≈ y media, moins le quart ≈ menos cuarto. French uses moins for minutes before the hour, like Spanish menos.
:::

Now we can get into some examples:

- **Il est onze heures moins dix →** It's 10:50, or 11:00 minus 10.
- **Il est douze heures et quart →** It's 12:15, or 12 plus a quarter.
- **Il est cinq heures moins le quart →** It's 4:45, or 5:00 minus a quarter.
- **Il est neuf heures et demie →** It's 9:30

### **specific amount of minutes**

---

To add a specific amount of minutes without going through the "minus a quarter" or "3 quarters" bullshit, you can simply append the minutes onto the end of "heures" like so:

- **Il est sept heures trente-cinq** = It's 7:35

## **AM and PM**

---

If you don't want to follow military time, you can say AM and PM with the french equivalents of "in the morning", "in the afternoon" and "in the night":

- _du matin_ (in the morning, _de la mañana_)
- _de l'après-midi_ (in the afternoon, _de la tarde_)
- _du soir_ (in the evening, _de la noche_)

Here are some examples:

- **Il est dix heures du matin →** It's 10'oclock in the morning
- **Il est quattre heures de l'après-midi →** It's 4'oclock in the afternoon.
- **Il est dix heures du soir →** It's 10'oclock in the evening

## **Colloquial emphasis**

---

To say the equivalents of "'oclock sharp" or "around oclock", you have these words in french:

- **pile:** when used with time, it is the equivalent of "sharp".
  - _Il est sept heures pile_ = It's 7 o'clock sharp
- **ver:** when used with time, it is the equivalent of "around".
  - _Il est vers sept heures_ = It's around 7 o'clock
- **environ:** when used with time, it is the equivalent of "about".
  - _Il est environ sept heures_ = It's about 7 o'clock

## Asking the time

To ask, the time, you can say, "Quelle heure est-il ?"

## Days of the week

- **Lundi:** Monday
- **Mardi:** Tuesday
- **Mercredi:** Wednesday
- **Jeudi:** Thursday
- **Vendredi:** Friday
- **Samedi:** Saturday
- **Dimanche:** Sunday

## Months of the year

- **Janvier:** January
- **Février:** February
