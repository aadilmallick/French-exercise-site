For example, you would say "hace calor" to say "it's hot", but that literally translates to "it makes hot" in english. You do the same thing in french, where you say "**Il fait chaud**" to literally translate to "it makes hot", which gives a general meaning of "it's hot"

In spanish, the word "tiempo" generally means time, but when used in weather grammar, it can mean "weather." The same thing occurs for the french word **temps**, which generally means time, but in a weather context, means the weather.
