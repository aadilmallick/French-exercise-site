# 1 - Articles + Liason Rule

## Definite and indefinite articles

In french, unlike english and spanish, a noun must frequently be paired with either a definite article, or an indefinite article.

- **definite articles:** The definite article is the equivalent of “the” in english
- **indefinite article**: The indefinite article is the equivalent of “a” in english, and includes partitive articles, which is french-specific.

Just like in spanish, articles for both the definite and indefinite articles are gendered and change based on plurality:

Here are the 3 definite articles, which all mean “the”

- **Le**: singular masculine
- **La**: singular feminine
- **Les**: plural masculine and feminine,

Then here are the three indefinite articles:

- **Des**: plural, equivalent of “some”, but look more at the partitive articles section.
- **Un**: singular masculine
- **Une**: singular feminine

## Liason rule

The most important rule in french is the liason rule. It is a rule that states that when a word starts with a vowel, You pronounce those two words differently. One of two things can happen:

1. The spelling does not change, but you must pronounce the last letter of the preceding word as to emphasize the vowel in the next word.
2. The spelling changes to a contraction, and you must pronounce the contraction.

**scenario 1**

---

for example for “**nous allons**,” you still have to pronounce the last letter of any word that directly precedes a word starting with a vowel. In this case, the liason rule is just a pronunciation rule, but it is a prominent one.

**scenario 2**

---

In these 4 cases, the spelling changes to a contraction, and you must pronounce the contraction.

1. The preceding word is the definite article "la" or "le". Note that "les" DOES NOT have the contraction, it only has the liason pronunciation.
2. The preceding word is an object pronoun like me, te, le, or la, and the succeeding word is a verb or infinitive starting with a vowel. The other ones only get the pronunciation rule.
3. The preceding word is the 1st person pronoun "je". This is the only pronoun that has the liason contraction rule.
4. The preceding word is the negation article "ne", which contracts with a verb to form "n'".

Here is a table of examples:

| Incorrect        | Correct         |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| La orange ❌     | L’orange ✅     |
| De la orange ❌  | De l’orange ✅  |
| Te attendre ❌   | T’attendre ✅   |
| Je ai ❌         | J’ai ✅         |
| Me aime ❌       | M'aime ✅       |
| Je ne aime pas❌ | J n'aime pas ✅ |

## Partitive articles

Partitive articles are used to indicate a specific quantity of something. They are used in the same way as the indefinite articles, but they are more specific.

- **Des**: plural, equivalent of “some”
- **De**: plural, equivalent of “some”

The partitive article is the equivalent of “some”, and has different forms depending on gender and plurality. It is based off of the preposition “de”, which translates to “of”.

> Je voudrais **des** oeufs, **du** lait et **de** **la** salade.

| French | When to use                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| des    | masculine or feminine plural object, **contraction of de les** |
| du     | masculine singular object, **contraction of de le**            |
| de la  | feminine singular object                                       |
| de l’  | singular object that starts with vowel                         |
| de     | Used in negatives or in front of proper nouns.                 |

We have two contraction rules here:

- **de + le → du:** We contract “de le” to “du” for singular masculine nouns, as it sounds less awkward
- **de + les → des:** We contract “de les” to “des” for singular masculine nouns, as it sounds less awkward

:::tip
When pronouncing “des”, the liason rule kicks in: the s is silent except for when the object starts with a vowel, like “des oranges”

Here are some examples:

- Example: *Des livres* (Some books/books). This refers to multiple books, but not specific ones.
- Example: *Des tables* (Some tables/tables). This refers to multiple tables, but not specific ones.

### **de after negation**

When using a negative sentence, the indefinite articles *un, une,* and *des* usually change to *de* (or *d'* before a vowel sound).

- Example: *J'ai un frère.* (I have a brother.)
  - *Je n'ai pas de frère.* (I don't have a brother.)
- Example: *Elle a une voiture.* (She has a car.)
  - *Elle n'a pas de voiture.* (She doesn't have a car.)
- Example: *Ils ont des enfants.* (They have children.)
  - *Ils n'ont pas d'enfants.* (They don't have children.)

When a sentence is negative, using “ne … pas” somewhere in it, then all of the endings just get truncated to “de”, like so:

- I want some milk = **Je veux du lait**
- I *don't* want any milk = **Je ne veux pas de lait**
