### On

On: This pronoun has multiple uses, which can be confusing for beginners.

- Impersonal "one": Similar to "one" in English. Example: En France, on mange bien. (In France, one eats well / people eat well.)
- Informal "we": Often used instead of "nous" in spoken French. Example: On va au cinéma. (We are going to the cinema.)
- "They" (in certain contexts): When the subject is a general group of people. Example: On dit que c'est difficile. (They say that it's difficult.)

:::info
Hypothetical Scenario: Imagine you are talking about a new restaurant. You might say, "On dit que c'est bon," meaning "They say it's good" or "I've heard it's good."
:::

- So the main difference between _on_ and _nous_ is that _on_ is used informally whereas _nous_ is used formally

- The main difference between _on_ and _ils_ and _elles_ is that _on_ is used when the subject is impersonal, not really referring to any single person or group of people, while _ils_ and _elles_ are used when the subject is a group of people.

### Revisit of the liason rule

ONly the "je" subject pronoun will have the liason rule, contracting with a verb that starts with a vowel:

- Example 1: j'ai une pomme

## Practice

Translate the following sentences into French, using the correct subject pronouns:

- I am happy.
- You are my friend (informal).
- He is a doctor.
- She is a teacher.
- We are students.
- You are welcome (formal).
- They are from Spain (masculine/mixed).
- They are sisters (feminine).

Rewrite the following sentences, replacing the nouns with the appropriate subject pronouns:

- Marie est intelligente.
- Pierre est grand.
- Marie et Pierre sont mariés.
- Sophie et Claire sont amies.
- Le livre est intéressant.
- La voiture est rapide.
